# This package holds unit tests for the LoL ban/pick project.
#
# You can create test modules in this directory to verify the
# correctness of your data collection and ban/pick logic.  For
# example, you might write tests to ensure that the API wrapper
# functions return expected data structures or that your ban/pick
# algorithm respects the hard fearless drafting rules.
